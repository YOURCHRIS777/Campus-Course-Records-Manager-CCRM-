# Campus-Course-Records-Manager-CCRM-
Campus Course &amp; Records Manager (CCRM) is a Java console app that helps institutes manage students, courses, enrollments, grades, and transcripts. It uses modern Java features, solid OOP, file import/export, and offers a simple menu-driven interface for easy data handling.




üóùÔ∏è Key Features:

Student Management: Add, update, and deactivate students with detailed profiles and enrollment tracking.

Course Management: Create and manage courses, assign instructors, and support powerful search and filtering using Java Streams.

Enrollment & Grading: Enroll students, record grades, compute GPA, and generate academic transcripts using polymorphism and enums.

File Utilities: Import and export data in CSV format, perform backups and archival using modern Java NIO.2 APIs.

CLI-Based Workflow: Interactive menu-driven console interface with full data operations and reporting capabilities.



üì° Technical Highlights:

Clear package organization adhering to Java best practices for modularity.

Implementation of core OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism.

Usage of Java 8+ features like lambdas, Streams API, Date/Time API, enums, and recursion.

Incorporates design patterns such as Singleton and Builder.

Robust exception handling with custom exceptions and assertions to maintain data integrity.

File management using Java NIO.2 for efficient and modern I/O.

Demonstrates comprehensive understanding of Java core concepts required in academic and enterprise-grade applications.
